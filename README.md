A very basic boilerplate to render the classic counter functionality in Redux and for accommodating react-hot-loader I have created two different ways to implement it, both without ejecting from create-react-app and with ejecting create-react-app.

While implementing the react-hot-loader without ejecting create-react-app I have followed [this guide](https://daveceddia.com/hot-reloading-create-react-app/)

Both of these projects were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Go seperately into each of the project directory and run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
